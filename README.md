# RetroArch 1.66x filter

This is the 1.19.1 build of RetroArch for Miyoo (Pocket Go, PowKiddy Q90/V90, New BittBoy) with the addition of the 1.66x upscale filter.

Recommended especially for Gameboy and Gameboy Color emulation. In these cases, the screen resolution of the device makes the GB/GBC image look bad without this filter. It is the same filter used in Gambatte-dms.
